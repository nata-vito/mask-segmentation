# U-Net for Skin Cancer Segmentation

![alt text](./assets/results.png)

The aim of this project is to train segmentation models with png mask. This work uses [UNet model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597) specialized in biomedical image segmentation in order to segment skin cancers. We used the dataset [Skin cancer: HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification/data), a easy download version of [The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) and trained the network. The dataset consists of .jpg images and .png binary masks.


## U-Net Architecture

The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. U-net architecture (example for 32x32 pixels in the lowest resolution) as presented in Figure 1. Each blue box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations. This work is based on [Ronneberger et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597).
